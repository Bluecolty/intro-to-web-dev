Suddenly, he <span id="adjective-three-output"></span>. He instantly regretted taking a walk. His <span id="adjective-four-output"></span> that he had in his hand flew away, quite literally, never to be seen again. He thought to himself, <span id="adjective-five-output"></span> sure was a weird place. This made him <span id="adjective-six-output"></span> to live there. His friend, <span id="adjective-seven-output"></span>saw him after his distress and came over to say hi. His friend had a great <span id="adjective-eight-output"></span> to talk about. As his friend was talking, he remembered he was in a Mad-Lib, which explained all the wacky word combinations. This thought gave him <span id="adjective-nine-output"></span>.</p>
