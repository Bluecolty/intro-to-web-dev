	<h3>Code</h3>
	  
	  	<div>
	  		<p>This is a P tag, it is done with the tag <strong><xmp><p></p></xmp></strong> To show the code, the xmp tag is used so the paragraph tags written out there do not render as an actual tag and instead render as text. <xmp><xmp>This is an xmp tag</xmp></xmp></p>
	  		<hr>
			<p>To add some spice to a webpage using HTML, one can use the <strong>strong tag</strong>. This tag is written as <xmp><strong></strong></xmp> This is another useful tag which bolds your text, <strong>like this.</strong></p>

	<h3>Favorites</h3><br>
	  	<div>
	  		<h6>Favorite book...</h6>
	  		<p>My favorite book is currently Jurassic Park. The book is much better than the movie, as it has a lot more details and combines a lot of good scenes from the second and third Jurassic Park movies.</p>
	  		<h6>Favorite Movie...</h6>
	  		<p>My favorite movie is Back to the Future. It's a classic and has a fantastic 80's vibe.</p>
	  		<h6>Favorite Quote...</h6>
	  		<p>I'm not sure where my favorite quote is from or who originally penned it, so I don't take credit for it. <strong>"You fail 100% of the things you don't attempt"</strong>. I find that to be a particularly motivating quote, and its one thats helped me decide to do a lot of things in my life that I wouldn't have otherwise done.</p>
